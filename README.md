This project implements an in-real-time DDoS detection system for general-purpose networks, ingesting live network traffic from various target machines including web servers, databases, and other network interfaces using Zeek for total surveillance. An light-weighted data pipeline based on RabbitMQ and Apache Flink processes network flows and derives key features. A deep neural network model following a CNN-LLM architecture separates traffic as benign or malicious. Upon detection of an attack, the system notifies firewall systems (Snort/Suricata) for automatic blocking and SIEM tools (Wazuh) for logging and forensic analysis. A retraining framework using Elasticsearch updates the model to evolving DDoS patterns continuously. Experimental results indicate a detection accuracy of more than 90% under simulated attack conditions.
Real-Time Network Monitoring: Traffic from multiple target machines is recorded in real time using Zeek and Wireshark to get end-to-end visibility of the network activity.
Lightweight Data Pipeline: RabbitMQ handles queuing network traffic, and Apache Flink processes data in real time to sanitize and derive significant features.
Advanced Deep Learning Model: A CNN-LLM model is developed and implemented to accurately classify network flows, leveraging convolutional layers for feature extraction and LLM layers for learning temporal relationships.
Automated Security Response: The system is integrated with firewall products (Snort/Suricata) to block malicious traffic detected and with SIEM products (Wazuh/Splunk) to log events and notify security teams.
Continuous Model Retraining: A retraining framework in place via local log storage and SIEM information ensures the deep learning model keeps adapting to developing attack patterns.
